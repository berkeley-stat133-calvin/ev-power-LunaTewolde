## Project Overview
This project analyzes whether U.S. states with higher renewable energy shares also have greater electric vehicle adoption in 2023.

## Data used  and Methods
datasets:
- Renewable energy use by state (2023)
- Total energy use by state (2023)
- Electric vehicle registrations by state (2023)


```{r}
# Load, clean, and join
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
renew_2023 <- read.csv("renew_use_2023.csv") |> clean_names()
total_2023 <- read.csv("total_energy_use_2023.csv") |> clean_names()
ev_2023 <- read.csv("ev-registrations-by_state_2023.csv") |> clean_names()

energy_2023 <- renew_2023 |>
  left_join(total_2023, by = "state") |>
  left_join(ev_2023, by = "state") |>
  mutate(renew_share = renewable_energy_use / total_energy_use * 100)
